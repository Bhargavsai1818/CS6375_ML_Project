"Although all of Germany's stated demands had been satisfied by the agreement, privately Hitler was furious that British interference had prevented him from seizing all of Czechoslovakia in one operation. In subsequent speeches Hitler attacked British and Jewish ""war-mongers"" and in January 1939 secretly ordered a major build-up of the German navy to challenge British naval supremacy. In March 1939, Germany invaded the remainder of Czechoslovakia and subsequently split it into the German Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia and a pro-German client state, the Slovak Republic. Hitler also delivered an ultimatum to Lithuania on 20 March 1939, forcing the concession of the Klaipėda Region, formerly the German Memelland.",wikipedia_world_war_ii_6311.txt,human,,
"The Renaissance began in times of religious turmoil. The Late Middle Ages was a period of political intrigue surrounding the Papacy, culminating in the Western Schism, in which three men simultaneously claimed to be true Bishop of Rome. While the schism was resolved by the Council of Constance 1414, a resulting reform movement known as Conciliarism sought to limit the power of the pope. Although the papacy eventually emerged supreme in ecclesiastical matters by the Fifth Council of the Lateran 1511, it was dogged by continued accusations of corruption, most famously in the person of Pope Alexander VI, who was accused variously of simony, nepotism, and fathering children most of whom were married off, presumably for the consolidation of power while a cardinal.",wikipedia_renaissance_2117.txt,human,,
"During the Renaissance, two more areas appeared. Mathematical notation led to algebra which, roughly speaking, consists of the study and the manipulation of formulas. Calculus, consisting of the two subfields differential calculus and integral calculus, is the study of continuous functions, which model the typically nonlinear relationships between varying quantities, as represented by variables. This division into four main areasarithmetic, geometry, algebra, and calculusendured until the end of the 19th century. Areas such as celestial mechanics and solid mechanics were then studied by mathematicians, but now are considered as belonging to physics. The subject of combinatorics has been studied for much of recorded history, yet did not become a separate branch of mathematics until the seventeenth century.",wikipedia_mathematics_5407.txt,human,,
"Renewed interest in the Magna Carta, the English Civil War, and the Glorious Revolution in the 17th century prompted the growth of political philosophy on the British Isles. Thomas Hobbes was the first philosopher to articulate a detailed social contract theory. Writing in the Leviathan 1651, Hobbes theorized that individuals living in the state of nature led lives that were ""solitary, poor, nasty, brutish and short"" and constantly waged a war of all against all. In order to prevent the occurrence of an anarchic state of nature, Hobbes reasoned that individuals ceded their rights to a strong, authoritarian power. In other words, Hobbes advocated for an absolute monarchy which, in his opinion, was the best form of government. Later, philosopher and physician John Locke would posit a different interpretation of social contract theory. Writing in his Two Treatises of Government 1689, Locke posited that all individuals possessed the inalienable rights to life, liberty and estate property. According to Locke, individuals would voluntarily come together to form a state for the purposes of defending their rights. Particularly important for Locke were property rights, whose protection Locke deemed to be a government's primary purpose. Furthermore, Locke asserted that governments were legitimate only if they held the consent of the governed. For Locke, citizens had the right to revolt against a government that acted against their interest or became tyrannical. Although they were not widely read during his lifetime, Locke's works are considered the founding documents of liberal thought and profoundly influenced the leaders of the American Revolution and later the French Revolution. His liberal democratic framework of governance remains the preeminent form of democracy in the world.",wikipedia_democracy_4892.txt,human,,
"In the mid-1920s quantum mechanics was developed to become the standard formulation for atomic physics. In 1923, the French physicist Louis de Broglie put forward his theory of matter waves by stating that particles can exhibit wave characteristics and vice versa. Building on de Broglie's approach, modern quantum mechanics was born in 1925, when the German physicists Werner Heisenberg, Max Born, and Pascual Jordan developed matrix mechanics and the Austrian physicist Erwin Schrödinger invented wave mechanics. Born introduced the probabilistic interpretation of Schrödinger's wave function in July 1926. Thus, the entire field of quantum physics emerged, leading to its wider acceptance at the Fifth Solvay Conference in 1927.",wikipedia_quantum_mechanics_1057.txt,human,,

"A fundamental feature of the theory is that it usually cannot predict with certainty what will happen, but only give probabilities. Mathematically, a probability is found by taking the square of the absolute value of a complex number, known as a probability amplitude. This is known as the Born rule, named after physicist Max Born. For example, a quantum particle like an electron can be described by a wave function, which associates to each point in space a probability amplitude. Applying the Born rule to these amplitudes gives a probability density function for the position that the electron will be found to have when an experiment is performed to measure it. This is the best the theory can do; it cannot say for certain where the electron will be found. The Schrödinger equation relates the collection of probability amplitudes that pertain to one moment of time to the collection of probability amplitudes that pertain to another.: 6787",wikipedia_quantum_mechanics_4839.txt,human,,
"Consumers benefited from falling prices for clothing and household articles such as cast iron cooking utensils, and in the following decades, stoves for cooking and space heating.

"Extinction is the disappearance of an entire species. Extinction is not an unusual event, as species regularly appear through speciation and disappear through extinction. Nearly all animal and plant species that have lived on Earth are now extinct, and extinction appears to be the ultimate fate of all species. These extinctions have happened continuously throughout the history of life, although the rate of extinction spikes in occasional mass extinction events. The CretaceousPaleogene extinction event, during which the non-avian dinosaurs became extinct, is the most well-known, but the earlier PermianTriassic extinction event was even more severe, with approximately 96 of all marine species driven to extinction. The Holocene extinction event is an ongoing mass extinction associated with humanity's expansion across the globe over the past few thousand years. Present-day extinction rates are 1001000 times greater than the background rate and up to 30 of current species may be extinct by the mid 21st century. Human activities are now the primary cause of the ongoing extinction event; global warming may further accelerate it in the future.

"The views of Niels Bohr, Werner Heisenberg and other physicists are often grouped together as the ""Copenhagen interpretation"". According to these views, the probabilistic nature of quantum mechanics is not a temporary feature which will eventually be replaced by a deterministic theory, but is instead a final renunciation of the classical idea of ""causality"". Bohr in particular emphasized that any well-defined application of the quantum mechanical formalism must always make reference to the experimental arrangement, due to the complementary nature of evidence obtained under different experimental situations.

"Climate and weather are two closely related but distinct phenomena that together shape the Earth's atmospheric conditions. While weather refers to the short-term conditions of the atmosphere, climate describes the long-term patterns of weather in a particular region over a long period of time.

Weather is the state of the atmosphere at a particular place and time, with respect to temperature, humidity, cloudiness, wind, and precipitation. It can change rapidly, even hourly, and is influenced by a variety of factors including air pressure differences, temperature differences, and the movement of air masses. Weather can be observed and measured using a variety of tools, including thermometers, barometers, anemometers, and rain gauges.

Climate, on the other hand, is the long-term pattern of weather in a particular region, typically measured over a period of 30 years or more. Climate is influenced by a variety of factors, including latitude, altitude, proximity to large bodies of water, and ocean currents.

"Healthy eating habits are essential for maintaining a balanced lifestyle and overall well-being. A balanced diet not only provides the necessary nutrients for the body to function properly but also helps prevent chronic diseases, boosts energy levels, and promotes a healthy weight. Here are some key elements of healthy eating habits:

1. Eat a variety of foods: Consuming a diverse range of foods ensures that you get all the necessary nutrients your body needs. Include fruits, vegetables, whole grains, lean proteins, and healthy fats in your diet.
2. Eat plenty of fruits and vegetables: Fruits and vegetables are rich in vitamins, minerals, and fiber. Aim to eat at least five servings of fruits and vegetables a day.
3. Choose whole grains: Whole grains, such as brown rice, whole wheat bread, and quinoa, are a good source of fiber, vitamins, and minerals. They also help keep you feeling full for longer periods of time.

"Evolution influences every aspect of the form and behaviour of organisms. Most prominent are the specific behavioural and physical adaptations that are the outcome of natural selection. These adaptations increase fitness by aiding activities such as finding food, avoiding predators or attracting mates. Organisms can also respond to selection by cooperating with each other, usually by aiding their relatives or engaging in mutually beneficial symbiosis. In the longer term, evolution produces new species through splitting ancestral populations of organisms into new groups that cannot or will not interbreed. These outcomes of evolution are distinguished based on time scale as macroevolution versus microevolution. Macroevolution refers to evolution that occurs at or above the level of species, in particular speciation and extinction, whereas microevolution refers to smaller evolutionary changes within a species or population, in particular shifts in allele frequency and adaptation. Macroevolution is the outcome of long periods of microevolution. Thus, the distinction between micro- and macroevolution is not a fundamental onethe difference is simply the time involved. However, in macroevolution, the traits of the entire species may be important. For instance, a large amount of variation among individuals allows a species to rapidly adapt to new habitats, lessening the chance of it going extinct, while a wide geographic range increases the chance of speciation, by making it more likely that part of the population will become isolated. In this sense, microevolution and macroevolution might involve selection at different levelswith microevolution acting on genes and organisms, versus macroevolutionary processes such as species selection acting on entire species and affecting their rates of speciation and extinction.",wikipedia_evolution_9723.txt,human,,

Furthermore, the emergence of representative government in Europe is believed to be a result of its political fragmentation. Political scientist David Stasavage attributes Europe's political fragmentation and democratization to the way the Roman Empire fell apart. After the Roman Empire was taken over by several small, divided Germanic tribes, small political entities were established, and rulers had to be weak enough to seek the approval of their subjects to fend off external dangers."
"The development of perspective was part of a wider trend toward realism in the arts. Painters developed other techniques, studying light, shadow, and, famously in the case of Leonardo da Vinci, human anatomy. Underlying these changes in artistic method was a renewed desire to depict the beauty of nature and to unravel the axioms of aesthetics, with the works of Leonardo, Michelangelo and Raphael representing artistic pinnacles that were much imitated by other artists. Other notable artists include Sandro Botticelli, working for the Medici in Florence, Donatello, another Florentine, and Titian in Venice, among others.",wikipedia_renaissance_7347.txt,human,,

"Evolution influences every aspect of the form and behaviour of organisms. Most prominent are the specific behavioural and physical adaptations that are the outcome of natural selection. These adaptations increase fitness by aiding activities such as finding food, avoiding predators or attracting mates. Organisms can also respond to selection by cooperating with each other, usually by aiding their relatives or engaging in mutually beneficial symbiosis. In the longer term, evolution produces new species through splitting ancestral populations of organisms into new groups that cannot or will not interbreed. These outcomes of evolution are distinguished based on time scale as macroevolution versus microevolution. Macroevolution refers to evolution that occurs at or above the level of species, in particular speciation and extinction, whereas microevolution refers to smaller evolutionary changes within a species or population, in particular shifts in allele frequency and adaptation. Macroevolution is the outcome of long periods of microevolution. Thus, the distinction between micro- and macroevolution is not a fundamental onethe difference is simply the time involved. However, in macroevolution, the traits of the entire species may be important. For instance, a large amount of variation among individuals allows a species to rapidly adapt to new habitats, lessening the chance of it going extinct, while a wide geographic range increases the chance of speciation, by making it more likely that part of the population will become isolated. In this sense, microevolution and macroevolution might involve selection at different levelswith microevolution acting on genes and organisms, versus macroevolutionary processes such as species selection acting on entire species and affecting their rates of speciation and extinction.",wikipedia_evolution_3551.txt,human,,
"The rules of quantum mechanics assert that the state space of a system is a Hilbert space and that observables of the system are Hermitian operators acting on vectors in that space  although they do not tell us which Hilbert space or which operators. These can be chosen appropriately in order to obtain a quantitative description of a quantum system, a necessary step in making physical predictions. An important guide for making these choices is the correspondence principle, a heuristic which states that the predictions of quantum mechanics reduce to those of classical mechanics in the regime of large quantum numbers. One can also start from an established classical model of a particular system, and then try to guess the underlying quantum model that would give rise to the classical model in the correspondence limit. This approach is known as quantization.: 299",wikipedia_quantum_mechanics_6203.txt,human,,

However, the lack of a correct theory of quantum gravity is an important issue in physical cosmology and the search by physicists for an elegant ""Theory of Everything"" TOE. Consequently, resolving the inconsistencies between both theories has been a major goal of 20th- and 21st-century physics.

"As the pre-solar nebula collapsed, conservation of angular momentum caused it to rotate faster. The center, where most of the mass collected, became increasingly hotter than the surroundings. As the contracting nebula spun faster, it began to flatten into a protoplanetary disc with a diameter of roughly 200 AU and a hot, dense protostar at the center. The planets formed by accretion from this disc, in which dust and gas gravitationally attracted each other, coalescing to form ever larger bodies. Hundreds of protoplanets may have existed in the early Solar System, but they either merged or were destroyed or ejected, leaving the planets, dwarf planets, and leftover minor bodies.",wikipedia_solar_system_1781.txt,human,,"The nebula that preceded our solar system collapsed, and as a result of angular momentum conservation, it started to spin faster.

"The paintings of the Italian Renaissance differed from those of the Northern Renaissance. Italian Renaissance artists were among the first to paint secular scenes, breaking away from the purely religious art of medieval painters. Northern Renaissance artists initially remained focused on religious subjects, such as the contemporary religious upheaval portrayed by Albrecht Dürer. Later, the works of Pieter Bruegel the Elder influenced artists to paint scenes of daily life rather than religious or classical themes. It was also during the Northern Renaissance that Flemish brothers Hubert and Jan van Eyck perfected the oil painting technique, which enabled artists to produce strong colors on a hard surface that could survive for centuries. A feature of the Northern Renaissance was its use of the vernacular in place of Latin or Greek, which allowed greater freedom of expression. This movement had started in Italy with the decisive influence of Dante Alighieri on the development of vernacular languages; in fact the focus on writing in Italian has neglected a major source of Florentine ideas expressed in Latin.

"The history of computers is a long and fascinating one, spanning over two centuries of innovation and development. The concept of a computing device can be traced back to the abacus, a manual calculating tool that was used as far back as 2500 BC. However, the modern computer as we know it today has its roots in the 19th century, with the invention of mechanical calculators and the development of mathematical and logical theories.

The first significant development in computing technology came in 1837 when Charles Babbage, an English mathematician, proposed the concept of a programmable computer. Babbage designed the Analytical Engine, a mechanical general-purpose computer that could perform any mathematical calculation given the right instructions. Although the machine was never built during his lifetime, Babbage's design laid the groundwork for modern computers.

In the early 20th century, several mathematicians and engineers made significant contributions to the development of computing technology.

"Germany's political disunitywith three dozen statesand a pervasive conservatism made it difficult to build railways in the 1830s.

Lacking a technological base at first, the Germans imported their engineering and hardware from Britain, but quickly learned the skills needed to operate and expand the railways. In many cities, the new railway shops were the centres of technological awareness and training, so that by 1850, Germany was self-sufficient in meeting the demands of railway construction, and the railways were a major impetus for the growth of the new steel industry. Observers found that even as late as 1890, their engineering was inferior to Britain's. However, German unification in 1871 stimulated consolidation, nationalisation into state-owned companies, and further rapid growth.

"Othniel C. Marsh, America's first palaeontologist, was the first to provide solid fossil evidence to support Darwin's theory of evolution by unearthing the ancestors of the modern horse. In 1877, Marsh delivered a very influential speech before the annual meeting of the American Association for the Advancement of Science, providing a demonstrative argument for evolution. For the first time, Marsh traced the evolution of vertebrates from fish all the way through humans. Sparing no detail, he listed a wealth of fossil examples of past life forms. The significance of this speech was immediately recognised by the scientific community, and it was printed in its entirety in several scientific journals.",wikipedia_evolution_2062.txt,human,,

Thus, the phase of Orcus's orbit is opposite to Pluto's: Orcus is at aphelion most recently in 2019 around when Pluto is at perihelion most recently in 1989 and vice versa.

The heliopause is considered the beginning of the interstellar medium. Beyond the heliopause, at around 230 AU, lies the bow shock: a plasma ""wake"" left by the Sun as it travels through the Milky Way.

"The Parliament of England had its roots in the restrictions on the power of kings written into Magna Carta 1215, which explicitly protected certain rights of the King's subjects and implicitly supported what became the English writ of habeas corpus, safeguarding individual freedom against unlawful imprisonment with the right to appeal. The first representative national assembly in England was Simon de Montfort's Parliament in 1265. The emergence of petitioning is some of the earliest evidence of parliament being used as a forum to address the general grievances of ordinary people.

"Mathematicians can find an aesthetic value to mathematics. Like beauty, it is hard to define, it is commonly related to elegance, which involves qualities like simplicity, symmetry, completeness, and generality. G. H. Hardy in A Mathematician's Apology expressed the belief that the aesthetic considerations are, in themselves, sufficient to justify the study of pure mathematics. He also identified other criteria such as significance, unexpectedness, and inevitability, which contribute to mathematical aesthetics. Paul Erdős expressed this sentiment more ironically by speaking of ""The Book"", a supposed divine collection of the most beautiful proofs. The 1998 book Proofs from THE BOOK, inspired by Erdős, is a collection of particularly succinct and revelatory mathematical arguments. Some examples of particularly elegant results included are Euclid's proof that there are infinitely many prime numbers and the fast Fourier transform for harmonic analysis.",wikipedia_mathematics_4064.txt,human,,

The relative political freedom they afforded was conducive to academic and artistic advancement. Likewise, the position of Italian cities such as Venice as great trading centres made them intellectual crossroads. Merchants brought with them ideas from far corners of the globe, particularly the Levant.

"Local vegetation cover impacts how much of the sunlight gets reflected back into space albedo, and how much heat is lost by evaporation. For instance, the change from a dark forest to grassland makes the surface lighter, causing it to reflect more sunlight. Deforestation can also modify the release of chemical compounds that influence clouds, and by changing wind patterns. In tropic and temperate areas the net effect is to produce significant warming, and forest restoration can make local temperatures cooler. At latitudes closer to the poles, there is a cooling effect as forest is replaced by snow-covered and more reflective plains. Globally, these increases in surface albedo have been the dominant direct influence on temperature from land use change.

"The history of computers is a long and fascinating one, spanning over two centuries of innovation and development. The concept of a computing device can be traced back to the abacus, a manual calculating tool that was used as far back as 2500 BC. However, the modern computer as we know it today has its roots in the 19th century, with the invention of mechanical calculators and the development of mathematical and logical theories.

The first significant development in computing technology came in 1837 when Charles Babbage, an English mathematician, proposed the concept of a programmable computer. Babbage designed the Analytical Engine, a mechanical general-purpose computer that could perform any mathematical calculation given the right instructions. Although the machine was never built during his lifetime, Babbage's design laid the groundwork for modern computers.

In the early 20th century, several mathematicians and engineers made significant contributions to the development of computing technology. Alan Turing, a British mathematician, introduced the Turing machine concept in 1936, which is considered the basis for modern computer science. The Turing machine is a theoretical device that",mistral,ai,history of computers,
"The 1987 Montreal Protocol, an international agreement to phase out production of ozone-depleting gases, has had benefits for climate change mitigation. Several ozone-depleting gases like chlorofluorocarbons are powerful greenhouse gases, so banning their production and usage may have avoided a temperature rise of 0.5 C1.0 C, as well as additional warming by preventing damage to vegetation from ultraviolet radiation. It is estimated that the agreement has been more effective at curbing greenhouse gas emissions than the Kyoto Protocol specifically designed to do so. The most recent amendment to the Montreal Protocol, the 2016 Kigali Amendment, committed to reducing the emissions of hydrofluorocarbons, which served as a replacement for banned ozone-depleting gases and are also potent greenhouse gases. Should countries comply with the amendment, a warming of 0.3 C0.5 C is estimated to be avoided.",wikipedia_climate_change_3193.txt,human,,
"Artificial selection is the intentional selection of traits in a population of organisms. This has been used for thousands of years in the domestication of plants and animals. More recently, such selection has become a vital part of genetic engineering, with selectable markers such as antibiotic resistance genes being used to manipulate DNA. Proteins with valuable properties have evolved by repeated rounds of mutation and selection for example modified enzymes and new antibodies in a process called directed evolution.",wikipedia_evolution_5827.txt,human,,
"Climate and weather are two closely related but distinct phenomena that together shape the Earth's atmospheric conditions. While weather refers to the short-term conditions of the atmosphere, climate describes the long-term patterns of weather in a particular region over a long period of time.

Weather is the state of the atmosphere at a particular place and time, with respect to temperature, humidity, cloudiness, wind, and precipitation. It can change rapidly, even hourly, and is influenced by a variety of factors including air pressure differences, temperature differences, and the movement of air masses. Weather can be observed and measured using a variety of tools, including thermometers, barometers, anemometers, and rain gauges.

Climate, on the other hand, is the long-term pattern of weather in a particular region, typically measured over a period of 30 years or more. Climate is influenced by a variety of factors, including latitude, altitude, proximity to large bodies of water, and ocean currents. Climate can be described in terms of temperature, precipitation, humidity, and wind patterns, among other factors.

There are several different types of climates around",mistral,ai,climate and weather,

My fathers family name being Pirrip, and my Christian name Philip, my infant tongue could make of both names nothing longer or more explicit than Pip. So, I called myself Pip, and came to be called Pip. I give Pirrip as my fathers family name, on the authority of his tombstone and my sister,Mrs. Joe Gargery, who married the blacksmith. As I never saw my father or my mother, and never saw any likeness of either of them for their days were long before the days of photographs, my first fancies regarding what they were like were unreasonably derived from their tombstones. The shape of the letters on my fathers, gave me an odd idea that he was a square, stout, dark man, with curly black hair. From the character and turn of the inscription, _Also Georgiana Wife of the Above_, I drew a childish conclusion that my mother was freckled and sickly.
